**ZProc let's you do shared-state parallelism without the perils of having shared-memory.**


**Behold, the power of ZProc:**

```python
import zproc

# Some initialization

ctx = zproc.Context(wait=True)  # wait for processes in this context
ctx.state["cookies"] = 0


# Define atomic operations

@zproc.atomic
def eat_cookie(state):
    """Eat a cookie atomically."""
    
    state["cookies"] -= 1
    print("nom nom nom")


@zproc.atomic
def bake_cookie(state):
    """Bake a cookie atomically."""

    state["cookies"] += 1
    print("Here's a cookie!")

# Fire up processes

@ctx.call_when_change('cookies')
def cookie_eater(_, state):
    """Eat cookies as they're baked."""
    
    eat_cookie(state)


for i in range(5):
    bake_cookie(ctx.state)
```

**Result:**

```
Here's a cookie!
Here's a cookie!
nom nom nom
Here's a cookie!
nom nom nom
Here's a cookie!
nom nom nom
Here's a cookie!
nom nom nom
nom nom nom
```

(yes, baker and eater run in different processes)

Oh, and you just did message passing, without realizing it! 

*ZProc abstracts away all the details around network programming & sockets.*

## Why use ZProc?

At the surface, it's just a better API for Message passing parallelism (using ZMQ).

Message passing can be tedious because of all the manual wiring involved.

ZProc lets you do shared state, message passing parallelism with a more pythonic, 
safe and, easy-to-use interface.

It does that by providing a global `dict`-like object; `State`.
`State` works _purely_ on message passing.

It also supports a fair bit of reactive programming, 
using [state watchers](http://zproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/state_watching.html).

Behind the covers, it uses the [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model),
a well-established pattern for parallelism.

It also boasts workers and auto-retrying features witnessed in Celery, 
but unlike Celery it doesn't need a broker.

There are also numerous thin-wrappers over the python standard library that aid you in doing chores related to Processes.

It aims to provide a complete, coherent, humane interface for doing Multi Tasking.

Bottom line, you'll have a lot more fun doing parallel/concurrent programming using ZProc, than anything else.

## Features

- üå† &nbsp; Process management

    -   [Process Factory](https://zproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#zproc.Context.process_factory)
    -   Remembers to kill processes when exiting, for general peace.
        (even when they're nested)
    -   Keeps a record of processes created using ZProc.
    -   [üîñ](https://zproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#context)

- üå† &nbsp; Process Maps
    
    - Automatically manages worker processes, and delegates tasks to them.
    -   [üîñ](https://zproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#context)    

- üå† &nbsp; Asynchronous paradigms without `async def`

    -   Build a combination of synchronous and asynchronous systems, with ease.
    -   By _watching_ for changes in state, without
        [Busy Waiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting).
    -   [üîñ](https://zproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#state)

- üå† &nbsp; 

    
- üå† &nbsp; Atomic Operations
    -   Perform an arbitrary number of operations on state as a single,
        atomic operation.
    -   [üîñ](https://zproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/atomicity.html)

## Caveats

-   The state only gets updated if you do it directly.<br>
    This means that if you mutate objects inside the state,
    they wont get reflected in the global state.

-   The state should be pickle-able.

-   It runs an extra Process for managing the state.<br>
    Its fairly lightweight though, and shouldn't add too
    much weight to your application.

## FAQ

-   Fast?

    -   Above all, ZProc is written for safety and the ease of use.
    -   However, since its written using ZMQ, it's plenty fast for most stuff.
    -   Run -> [üîñ](eamples/async_vs_zproc.py) for a taste.

-   Stable?

    -   Mostly. However, since it's still in the `0.x.x` stage, you can expect some API changes. 

-   Production ready?

    -   Please don't use it in production right now.

-   Windows compatible?

    -   Probably?

## Inner Workings

-   ZProc uses a Server, which is responsible for storing and communicating the state.

    -   This isolates our resource (state), and makes it safer to do atomic operations.

-   The process(s) communicate through ZMQ sockets, over `ipc://`.

    -   The clients (Proceses) use a `ZMQ_DEALER` socket.
    -   The Server uses a `ZMQ_ROUTER` socket.

-   If a Process wishes to _watch_ the state, it subscribes to a global publish message.
    -   The zproc server publishes the state at every state update.
        (using `ZMQ_PUB` socket)
    -   A Process may subscribe to this message and
        filter out the event it needs (using `ZMQ_SUB` socket).
    -   zmq sockets block your application efficiently
        till an update occurs, eliminating the need for Busy Waiting.

(Busy waiting refers to the `while True: <check condition>` approach).
